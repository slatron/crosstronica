  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>My name is Mike Slater and I have been creating websites for the past 17 years. My focus has alwys been on frontend web deveopent.</p>

<p>I began with simple HTML table layouts and inline font attributes. Ever since discovering css, I’ve been hooked on client-side programming.  I learned enough PHP and SQL for basic server-side functionality, but felt more at home writing jQuery plugins than databases. At least early on.</p>

<p>For years I was content turning custom designed photoshop mocks into working websites. I couldn’t design much from am blank page myself, but I got real good at writing cross-browser HTML, CSS and Javascript<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<h4 id="feds-grow-up">FEDs Grow Up</h4>

<p>Around the time Sass and Knockout came around, I began to feel less like a div-jockey and more like a real Web Developer. I was finally understaning why someone would need build control and pre-compilers. Github became just as part as my workflow as my text editor and terminal were. Oh yeah, and at some point I had come to rely on the terminal for everyting.</p>

<p>Which starts with a single gulp command to make this all happen for me as I simply write code.</p>

<p>Now that I have started using angular to build some small apps, I feel even more like a developer. Mostly because I have to think differently about how I structure my code. I always knew how to structure javascript code in many different ways, but I never knew when to use them. Because angular enforces dependency injection early on, I could finally make that connection. I feel like I can make better decisions about starting a project after just two months of using angular.</p>

<h4 id="blog-intentions">Blog Intentions</h4>

<p>This blog exists to document the develpoment of a cross-stitch helper application written with angular. As I mentioned, I have only been using angular for two months as of this writing. I intend to log the progress of the app here and discuss how I feel about angular through the development process.</p>

<p>I chose Jekyll as my blog platform for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am already using git heavily and Jekyll is designed to fit with a git workflow</li>
  <li>I’m not interested in focusing on the design / style / theme of the blog itself for now</li>
  <li>Jekyll will assist in getting a quick n’ dirty blog platform up so I can start writing content</li>
  <li>With Jekyll, I can build UI functionality into the blog as it’s needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Key here is getting something going that will encourage me to write content. I have a rough outline of posts thought out before even starting the application. Every post may not be good, but if I want to get better at writing, I need to actually write every day.</p>

<p>These posts will help me to discover and solidify what I want to get out of the app. I started out with a vague idea of building a very limited graphic editor for color-coded crossstitch patterns. I’m looking forward to seeing where this ends up.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>-Mike</p>

<p><sub>1</sub> Which was just jQuery for much of that time</p>
